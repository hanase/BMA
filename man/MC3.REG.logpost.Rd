\title{ Helper function to MC3.REG  }
\description{
  Helper function to MC3.REG that calculates the posterior model probability (up to a constant).
}
\usage{
MC3.REG.logpost(Y, X, model.vect, p, i, K, nu, lambda, phi)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Y}{the vector of scaled responses.}
  \item{X}{the matrix of scaled covariates.}
  \item{model.vect}{ logical vector indicating which variables are to be included in the model }
  \item{p}{number of variables in model.vect}
  \item{i}{ vector of possible outliers}
  \item{K}{ a hyperparameter indicating the outlier inflation factor }
  \item{nu}{ regression hyperparameter. Default value is 2.58 if r2 for the full model is less than 0.9 
             or 0.2 if r2 for the full model is greater than 0.9. }
  \item{lambda}{ regression hyperparameter. Default value is 0.28 if r2 for the full model is less than 0.9 
             or 0.1684 if r2 for the full model is greater than 0.9. }
  \item{phi}{ regression hyperparameter. Default value is 2.85 if r2 for the full model is less than 0.9 
             or 9.2 if r2 for the full model is greater than 0.9.  }

}
\value{
  The log-posterior distribution for the model (up to a constant).

\note{ The implementation here differs from the Splus implentation. The Splus implementation uses global variables to contain the state of the current model and the history of the Markov-Chain. This implentation passes the current state and history to the function and then returns the updated state. }
