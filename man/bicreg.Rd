\title{Bayesian Model Averaging for linear regression models.}
\description{Bayesian Model Averaging accounts for the model uncertainty inherent in the variable selection problem by averaging over the best models in the model class according to approximate posterior model probability.
}
\usage{
bicreg(x, y, wt = rep(1, length(y)), strict = FALSE, OR = 20, 
       maxCol = 31, drop.factor.levels = TRUE, nbest = 150)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a matrix of independent variables }
  \item{y}{ a vector of values for the dependent variable }
  \item{wt}{ a vector of weights for regression }
  \item{strict}{ logical. FALSE returns all models whose posterior model probability is within a factor of 1/OR of that of the best model. TRUE returns a more parsimonious set of models, where any model with a more likely submodel is eliminated.  }
  \item{OR}{ a number specifying the maximum ratio for excluding models in Occam's window }
  \item{maxCol}{ a number specifying the maximum number of columns in the design matrix (including the intercept) to be kept. }
  \item{drop.factor.levels}{ logical. Indicates whether factor levels can be individually dropped in the stepwise procedure to reduce the number of columns in the design matrix, or if a factor can be dropped only in its entirety. }
  \item{nbest}{ a value specifying the number of models of each size
    returned to bic.glm by the leaps algorithm. The default is 150
    (replacing the original default of 10).}

}
\value{
  \code{bicreg} returns an object of class \code{bicreg}
  
 The function 'summary' is used to print a summary of the results. The function 'plot' is used to plot posterior distributions for the coefficients.

An object of class \code{bicreg} is a list containing at least the following components:

  \item{postprob}{the posterior probabilities of the models selected}
  \item{namesx}{the names of the variables}
  \item{label}{labels identifying the models selected}
  \item{r2}{R2 values for the models}
  \item{bic}{values of BIC for the models}
  \item{size}{the number of independent variables in each of the models}
  \item{which}{a logical matrix with one row per model and one column per variable indicating whether that variable is in the model}
  \item{probne0}{the posterior probability that each variable is non-zero (in percent)}
  \item{postmean}{the posterior mean of each coefficient (from model averaging)}
  \item{postsd}{the posterior standard deviation of each coefficient (from model averaging) }
  \item{condpostmean}{the posterior mean of each coefficient conditional on the variable being included in the model}
  \item{condpostsd}{the posterior standard deviation of each coefficient conditional on the variable being included in the model}
  \item{ols}{matrix with one row per model and one column per variable giving the OLS estimate of each coefficient for each model}
  \item{se}{matrix with one row per model and one column per variable giving the standard error of each coefficient for each model}
  \item{reduced}{a logical indicating whether any variables were dropped before model averaging}
  \item{dropped}{a vector containing the names of those variables dropped before model averaging}
  \item{residvar}{residual variance for each model}
  \item{call}{the matched call that created the bicreg object}
